- Auto-reconnect: working (session-based; no process restart required)
- Mode switching without restart: working (new HELLO tears down old Session, starts new one)
- Wireless adb + USB adb coexist: working (adb reverse uses -s <serial> to avoid multi-device error)
- WiFi→USB hot-switch: working (Phase 4b — always-on USB monitor + Android probe retry)

## Licensing
The app is intended for commercial sale. All bundled assets and dependencies must use permissive licenses (no GPL/copyleft, no CC-BY-SA).
- **Cursor assets**: CC0 — safe.
- **x264**: GPL-licensed — Now OPTIONAL (CMake option `POCKETDISPLAY_ENABLE_X264`, default OFF). Media Foundation H.264 encoder (hardware → software MFT fallback) is the default non-GPL encoder for commercial builds.

## Known Issues / Deferred
- **Resize cursor detection fails in custom-cursor apps** (e.g. Claude Desktop) — Windows-side cursor-type detection only matches standard `IDC_SIZE*` handles. Deferred.
- **VDD extended display (#20)** — true borderless extended display. Deferred.
- **Housekeeping**: consolidate `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` into `CLAUDE.md`; delete merged branches.

## Recently Fixed
- **Session-ID ACK ordering race (black screen on EVERY connect)** ✅
  - **Root cause**: `onCodecConfiguredInternal()` fires the ACK loop immediately when codec config (type-1) arrives. `currentSessionId` is only populated when `onSenderIpReceived()` is called with a non-zero value from the stream_info (type-2) message. Because both messages arrive close together on the network thread and the callback is posted to the main thread, codec-config could be processed (and ACK sent) before `currentSessionId` was updated from 0. Windows rejects ACKs with session_id=0 as stale → `android_ready_` never becomes true → black screen on every connect.
  - **Fix (Android, `ConnectionManager.kt`)**: `onCodecConfiguredInternal` ACK loop now checks `currentSessionId != 0` before calling `sendAck()`. If still 0, retries every 100ms. Guarantees first ACK always carries the correct non-zero session_id.
  - **Fix (Android, `TouchSender.kt`)**: Added `pendingAckSession` field — the buffered-flush path (when touch socket connects after ACK was queued) now sends the stored session_id instead of the default 0.
  - **Fix (Windows, `Session.h/cpp`)**: `last_stale_id_logged_` atomic suppresses repeated stale-ACK log spam (log once per unique stale id). Defence-in-depth; primary fix is Android not sending 0.
  - Committed `01e99f2`; both apps built and APK installed.

- **Reconnect black screen — Two-sided session-ID handshake (ROOT CAUSE FIX)** ✅
  - **Root cause**: Windows-side stale-ACK filtering created a DEADLOCK on reconnect. Windows session 2 rejected EVERY ACK as "Duplicate ACK for session 1 ignored" (26+ times) because Android had no concept of session ID — it kept sending ACKs that Windows attributed to the old session. `android_ready_` never became true for session 2, so `StreamLoop` never started, Android got 0 frames (black screen).
  - **Fix (Protocol v2: Two-sided session-ID handshake)**:
    1. **Protocol version bumped to 2**: Added `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2` in `Protocol.h`.
    2. **Windows sends session_id**: `ResendLoop` now sends 16-byte stream_info (was 12 bytes): `[w(uint32), h(uint32), flags(uint32), session_id(uint16), padding(uint16)]`. Session ID is per-Session (uint16_t, wraps at 65535, 0 reserved).
    3. **Android receives and stores session_id**: `TcpStreamReceiver.kt` extracts session_id from stream_info type-2 message (bytes 12-13) and passes it to `onSenderIp(ip, sessionId)`.
    4. **Android echoes session_id in ACK**: `TouchSender.kt` `sendAck(sessionId)` includes session_id in ACK packet bytes [6-7] (big-endian uint16). ConnectionManager stores `currentSessionId` and resets it to 0 on each disconnect.
    5. **Windows validates ACK session_id**: `TouchReceiver.cpp` extracts session_id from ACK and passes to callback. `Session.cpp` callback validates `ack_session_id == session_id_` before accepting. Stale ACKs from old sessions are rejected with log: "Stale ACK from session X ignored (current=Y)".
  - **Backward compatibility**: Protocol v1 clients (old Android builds) send ACK with session_id=0, which will be rejected by v2 Windows server (session_id starts at 1). Both apps must be updated together.
  - **Verification**: On reconnect, Windows logs show session ID incrementing (1, 2, 3...). Each new session's ACK is accepted and streaming starts immediately. No "Stale ACK" spam on successful reconnects.
  - Changed files: `windows/src/Protocol.h`, `windows/src/Session.h/cpp`, `windows/src/TouchReceiver.h/cpp`, `android/.../TcpStreamReceiver.kt`, `android/.../TouchSender.kt`, `android/.../ConnectionManager.kt`.

- **Reconnect black screen — ACK/android_ready state machine fix (PREVIOUS ATTEMPT)** ✅
  - **Root cause**: On reconnect, the new session would receive ACKs but the capture pipeline never started. Two issues: (1) Stale ACKs from the previous session could arrive and set `android_ready_=true` on the wrong session object. (2) No idempotency - duplicate ACKs kept firing the callback repeatedly without verifying the state actually transitioned. The `StreamLoop` waited for `android_ready_=true` but the one-way flag had no session validation.
  - **Fix (Session-based ACK validation + idempotency)**:
    1. **Per-session ID**: Added `session_id_` (unique per Session) captured by value in the ACK callback. Stale ACKs from previous sessions are discarded with a log message.
    2. **Idempotent transition**: Changed from `store(true)` to `compare_exchange_strong(expected=false, true)` so only the first ACK for this session triggers the transition. Duplicate ACKs are logged but ignored.
    3. **Comprehensive logging**: Added `[Session] Session ID N starting (android_ready=false)`, `[Session] ACK received — android_ready N false->true, streaming starts`, `[Session] Stale ACK from session X ignored (current=Y)`, `[Session] Duplicate ACK for session N ignored (already ready)`, `[PIPE] StreamLoop: android_ready=true for session N, starting capture`, and `[Session] Resolution changed N - android_ready reset to false (waiting for new ACK)`.
  - **Note**: This was an incomplete fix — it prevented stale ACKs from the SAME callback lambda from triggering, but didn't solve the Android→Windows direction (Android had no session concept). The "Two-sided session-ID handshake" fix above completes the solution.
  - Changed files: `windows/src/Session.h/cpp`.
- **Reconnect broken — Process-lifetime ScreenCapture** ✅
  - **Root cause**: DXGI Desktop Duplication allows only ONE active `IDXGIOutputDuplication` per output per process. Previous fixes (lifecycle tracking, use_count validation) tried to ensure the old Session was fully destroyed before creating a new one, but there was always a reference hiding somewhere (worker threads, lambdas, etc.). The latest log showed "no handle" in the destructor — meaning the wrong object was being destroyed.
  - **Fix (process-lifetime capture)**: Changed approach completely — **make ScreenCapture a process-lifetime object**, decoupled from Session lifecycle.
    1. **ScreenCapture** now supports `external_capture_mode_`. When enabled, `Release()` does NOT release the `IDXGIOutputDuplication` — it stays alive for reuse. Added `ForceReinitialize()` for explicit output changes (VDD appears/disappears).
    2. **Session** now accepts `external_capture` in Config. When set, Session:
       - Does NOT call `Initialize()` on the external capture (caller must)
       - Does NOT call `Release()` on the external capture during `Stop()`
       - Uses `capture_ptr_` to access the borrowed capture
    3. **main.cpp** creates one `process_capture` at startup, sets external mode, and passes it to all Sessions. Sessions borrow the capture — `DuplicateOutput` is called only ONCE at first session startup. On reconnect, the new Session simply reuses the existing capture.
    4. **Output change detection**: main.cpp tracks `last_capture_adapter/output`. If the requested output differs (e.g., Extended VDD appeared), it explicitly reinitializes the process capture before creating the new Session.
  - **Instrumentation**: `[ScreenCapture] Already initialized - reusing existing duplication`, `[ScreenCapture] External mode - preserving IDXGIOutputDuplication`, `[Session] Using EXTERNAL capture`, `[HELLO] Reusing existing process-lifetime capture`, `[HELLO] Process-lifetime capture ready`, `[Main] Releasing process-lifetime capture` — confirms single init/reuse behavior.
  - **Verification**: DuplicateOutput is called exactly ONCE per process lifetime (unless output changes). Reconnect cycles work without DXGI errors.
  - Changed files: `windows/src/ScreenCapture.h/cpp`, `windows/src/Session.h/cpp`, `windows/src/main.cpp`.
- **Media Foundation config-at-init deadlock (Android black screen)** ✅
  - **Root cause**: `Session::StreamLoop` skips capture while `!android_ready_`, so it never feeds the encoder. `android_ready_` only becomes true after Android ACKs the codec config (SPS/PPS), which Session sends via `encoder_->GetConfigPacket()`. The old x264 encoder produced SPS/PPS at `Initialize()` (via `x264_encoder_headers`), so `GetConfigPacket()` returned valid data immediately and the handshake completed. But HwEncoder (MF/NVENC) only produces SPS/PPS AFTER the first frame is encoded — which never happens because the loop won't feed frames until `android_ready_`. Deadlock → encoder fires NeedInput #1 then idles forever → black screen on BOTH NVENC and software MFT.
  - **Fix (surgical, preserves handshake)**: Added `PrimeEncoder()` method that feeds a single black NV12 frame (luma=0x10, chroma=0x80) at the end of `Initialize()`, pumps `ProcessInput`/`ProcessOutput` (handles ASYNC vs SYNC paths) until `MF_MT_MPEG_SEQUENCE_HEADER` or inline SPS/PPS is produced and cached. The primed output frame is discarded (not sent). After this, `GetConfigPacket()` returns SPS/PPS synchronously, matching the old x264 contract. `pts_` is reset to 0 so the first REAL frame starts clean.
  - **Defense-in-depth**: First real keyframe has SPS/PPS prepended in-band (Annex-B: SPS, PPS, then IDR) so Android can configure even if csd-0 timing is off. Tracked via `first_keyframe_done_` flag.
  - **Verification logging**: `[Prime] Black frame submitted`, `[Prime] SPS/PPS extracted`, `[Prime] SUCCESS`, `[PIPE] First keyframe: prepended SPS/PPS in-band`.
  - Changed files: `windows/src/HwEncoder.cpp`, `windows/src/HwEncoder.h`.
- **Media Foundation black screen fix — SYNC vs ASYNC MFT** ✅
  - **Root cause**: The code assumed all MFTs are ASYNC (event-driven), but the **software H.264 MFT is SYNCHRONOUS** and does NOT fire `METransformNeedInput`/`METransformHaveOutput` events. The encoder was being "driven" incorrectly, resulting in zero output frames.
  - **Fix**: Detect `MF_TRANSFORM_ASYNC` on the MFT during initialization:
    - ASYNC MFTs (NVENC): Use event-driven model with `EventLoop` thread
    - SYNC MFTs (software): Drive directly with `ProcessInput` followed by `ProcessOutput` drain loop in `EncodeFrame`
  - **Timestamp fix**: Set both `SetSampleTime` AND `SetSampleDuration` in `MakeNv12Sample` (NVENC requires valid timestamps). Duration = 1/fps in 100ns units.
  - **Pipeline instrumentation**: Added `[PIPE]` prefixed logging throughout:
    - Session capture loop: `[PIPE] captured frame N`, `[PIPE] calling EncodeFrame N`, `[PIPE] EncodeFrame returned nal=<bytes>`, `[PIPE] sent N bytes to socket`
    - HwEncoder: logs MFT type (ASYNC/SYNC), event counts, ProcessInput/ProcessOutput HRESULTs
  - Changed files: `windows/src/HwEncoder.cpp`, `windows/src/HwEncoder.h`, `windows/src/Session.cpp`.
- **Media Foundation bitstream fix (black screen issue)** ✅
  - **Root cause**: Media Foundation H.264 encoder outputs **AVCC format** (4-byte length-prefixed NALs), but Android MediaCodec expects **Annex-B format** (00 00 00 01 start codes).
  - **SPS/PPS extraction**: MF stores codec config in `MF_MT_MPEG_SEQUENCE_HEADER` attribute (after first `MF_E_TRANSFORM_STREAM_CHANGE`), NOT inline like x264. The code now reads this attribute and converts AVCC to Annex-B.
  - **NAL format conversion**: Added `ConvertAvccToAnnexB()` helper to convert MF's AVCC output to Annex-B format that Android expects.
  - **Keyframe/IDR**: Set `CODECAPI_AVEncVideoForceKeyFrame` for first frame and `CODECAPI_AVEncMPVGOPSize=60` for periodic keyframes (1 second at 60fps).
  - **Diagnostic logging**: Added Windows-side logging (config packet hex, first 5 frames size/keyframe status) and Android-side logging (csd-0 hex, configure result, decoded frame count) for visibility.
  - Changed files: `windows/src/HwEncoder.cpp`, `android/app/src/main/java/com/pocketdisplay/app/VideoDecoder.kt`.
- x264 GPL dependency removed ✅
  - Gated x264 behind `POCKETDISPLAY_ENABLE_X264` CMake option (default OFF) for commercial builds.
  - Media Foundation H.264 encoder is now default with hardware → software MFT fallback.
  - Updated `Session::Config::hw_enc` default to `true` (MF encoder enabled by default).
  - Added `--sw` CLI flag to force software encoding; removed `--hw` flag (now default).
- PR #24: Touch/cursor accuracy + Windows-style cursor shapes ✅
  - Touch lands exactly at touch point (toNormalized inversion fix, feature/cursor-fixes).
  - 11 Windows-style cursor shapes from CC0 SVG assets converted to VectorDrawables with per-type fractional hotspots in CursorOverlayView. Arrow hotspot at tip; hand hotspot at index fingertip (hx=0.397, hy=0.076); resize cursors centered.
  - Hand cursor regenerated as solid silhouette (fillType nonZero). Resize_h and resize_v regenerated from new dedicated SVGs (resize_v bakes the SVG root rotate(90) into a group android:rotation).
- PR #23: Extended-mode cursor hide + letterbox-fit + touch orientation + nav/About ✅
  - Cursor overlay hides when PC cursor leaves the extended display region (sentinel type=0xFF).
  - Letterbox-fit scaling with correct touch mapping; nav bar cleanup; About page.
- Phase 4f: Disconnect button regression fix ✅
  - Root cause (regression from 4e): stopCurrentSession() always triggered an immediate tryConnect() (added in 4e for fast involuntary reconnect). Since both the Disconnect button and internal hot-switch paths called stopCurrentSession(), manual disconnect instantly auto-reconnected.
  - Fix: introduced @Volatile userDisconnected flag in ConnectionManager. Manual disconnect (Disconnect button / HUD Disconnect) calls the new userDisconnect() which sets userDisconnected=true before calling stopCurrentSession(). retryConnect() (Connect button) clears the flag. All 8 auto-reconnect paths are guarded: stopCurrentSession() immediate trigger, fallbackPollRunnable, onUsbConnected() probe, startWifiDiscovery() callback, tryConnect() main-thread post, onResume(), onSurfaceAvailable(), and onUsbDisconnected()→startWifiDiscovery().
  - Distinction: ONLY userDisconnect() sets the flag. Internal hot-switch paths (onUsbConnected, onUsbDisconnected, surface lifecycle) call stopCurrentSession() directly and do NOT set the flag, so involuntary drops still auto-recover as before.
  - Changed files: android/.../ConnectionManager.kt, android/.../MainActivity.kt
- Phase 4e: Connection Mode label (actual fix) + reconnect speed (actual fix) ✅
  - Label fix (Issue 1) — root cause: stopCurrentSession() called onTransport("—") on every session end, always resetting the dashboard label to "—". Since tvConnectionMode is inside homePanel (only visible when NOT streaming), the user only ever saw "—" (after disconnect) or briefly "USB"/"Wi-Fi" during the <500ms connecting window before showStreamingUi() hid homePanel. The previous attempt (re-emitting onTransport in onSenderIpReceived) fired during connect, but homePanel hid immediately after. Real fix: removed onTransport("—") from stopCurrentSession() — label now retains last-known transport ("USB" or "Wi-Fi") while on the dashboard. Changed file: android/.../ConnectionManager.kt
  - Reconnect speed (Issue 2) — root cause: after stopCurrentSession(), the ONLY automatic reconnect trigger was fallbackPollRunnable (10s interval), causing 0–10s random wait before any reconnect attempt. Touch socket timing (300ms+100ms=400ms/attempt) was not the primary bottleneck. Real fix: added immediate mainHandler.post { Thread { tryConnect() }.start() } at the end of stopCurrentSession(), guarded by !destroyed && receiver==null && surface!=null. Also added @Volatile destroyed flag (set in destroy() before stopCurrentSession()) to prevent spurious reconnect on app exit. onSurfaceDestroyed() already sets surface=null before calling stopCurrentSession(), so that guard also fires correctly. Touch retry further tightened: 200ms+50ms=250ms/attempt. Changed files: android/.../ConnectionManager.kt, android/.../TouchSender.kt
  - Codec-config spam (Item 3 from prior session): Session::ResendLoop sent stream_info + codec_config unconditionally every 2s, causing continuous "Codec config received" log noise on Android even mid-stream. Added !android_ready_.load() guard so resending stops once ACK is received; automatically resumes when android_ready_ is reset (encoder re-init on resolution change, or new Session from reconnect). Changed file: windows/src/Session.cpp
- Phase 4b: WiFi→USB hot-switch + Connection Mode label ✅
  - Root cause: StartUsbMonitorThread was only started when USB was present at app launch. Starting in WiFi mode meant no USB monitor ran, so adb reverse was never set up when a cable was plugged mid-session. Android probed 127.0.0.1:7777 once, failed silently, gave up.
  - Windows fix: StartUsbMonitorThread now called unconditionally after startup (main.cpp), regardless of whether USB was present at launch. Monitor detects absent→present USB transition and runs RunAdbUsbReverse(-s <serial> tcp:7777 + tcp:7778) without touching the active WiFi session.
  - Android fix: onUsbConnected() now retries probeHost("127.0.0.1") every 1 s for up to 5 s (instead of one-shot), catching the window while Windows sets up adb reverse. Each attempt is logged. On success: stopCurrentSession() + startUsbSession() with saved mode (no dialog).
  - Label fix: startWifiDiscovery() now fires onTransport("Wi-Fi") before the early-return guard, ensuring the Connection Mode label always updates to "Wi-Fi" even when discovery was already running.
  - Changed files: windows/src/main.cpp, android/.../ConnectionManager.kt
- #19: Auto-switch USB/WiFi — UsbManager detection on startup + BroadcastReceiver for plug/unplug ✅
  - Follow-up: Fixed black screen/reconnect loop on WiFi→USB switch — race condition where old WiFi StreamReceiver threads were still alive when TcpStreamReceiver started. Fix: explicit stopReceiver() + 600ms postDelayed before setMode(true)+autoStartIfNeeded(). Also added reverse USB→WiFi auto-detection (probe failure → same stop+delay+setMode pattern). ✅
  - Bug 1: Fixed adb reverse lost after USB reconnect — added StartUsbMonitorThread() in AdbUsbSetup.cpp that polls DetectUsbDevice() every 3s and re-runs RunAdbUsbReverse() on device absent→present transition. Started in main.cpp after initial adb reverse. ✅
  - Bug 2: Extended mode logging — added raw mode-line log in TcpVideoServer::AcceptLoop() before parsing; confirmed both WiFi and USB paths parse "extend" correctly. ✅
  - Bug 3: Fixed random Windows crashes — ScreenCapture now stores adapter_idx_/output_idx_ and guards CaptureFrame() with null check on duplication_ (re-inits on DXGI_ERROR_ACCESS_LOST / resolution change). Main loop wrapped in try-catch; crashes logged to PocketDisplay_crash.log. ✅
- #19 post-testing fixes (3 remaining bugs):
  - Bug 1 (CRITICAL): Fixed Windows crash in libx264-164.dll during Extended mode — three-layer fix: (1) ScreenCapture::CaptureFrame validates mapped.pData non-null and RowPitch≥width*4 before memcpy; (2) Encoder::EncodeFrame guards null bgra/handle, delegates x264_encoder_encode to SafeX264Encode() static helper wrapped in __try/__except (C2712 fix); (3) main.cpp capture loop detects resolution change (w/h != stream_w/h), closes and re-inits encoder with new dims, resets android_ready to force codec-config resend. stream_w/stream_h are std::atomic<int> so resend_thread always sends current dims. ✅
  - Bug 2 (HIGH): Fixed adb reverse lost after USB reconnect — removed `receiver?.isRunning != true && tcpReceiver?.isRunning != true` guard from both branches of usbPollRunnable in MainActivity.kt. USB is now probed every 3s regardless of whether a WiFi receiver is actively streaming, so reconnecting USB cable triggers mode-switch even mid-stream. The inner `if (!usbMode)` / `if (usbMode)` guards still prevent double-switching. ✅
  - Bug 3 (MEDIUM): Fixed Extended mode showing Mirror — three-part fix: (1) RunDiscovery in main.cpp no longer requires phase2 (CLIENT received) before accepting POCKETDISPLAY_MODE; if CLIENT was lost, android_ip is inferred from MODE sender IP, prevents 30s timeout → Mirror fallback; added raw mode_str log. (2) TcpVideoServer::AcceptLoop always updates mode_value_ on each connection (removed keep-first guard) so reconnect with different mode is reflected. (3) Added Log.i in MainActivity.sendModeSelection for WiFi path tracing. ✅
- #19 second post-testing session (4 more bugs):
  - Bug 1 (CRITICAL): Fixed Android-first + USB black screen — usbPollRunnable now checks firstFrameReceived before stopReceiver(). If WiFi was idle/connecting (not streaming), goes directly to setMode(true)+autoStartIfNeeded() with no stopReceiver() and no delay. stopReceiver() on a never-connected WiFi receiver was corrupting state and leaving black screen. If WiFi IS streaming (firstFrameReceived=true), still does stopReceiver()+600ms+setMode(true). ✅
  - Bug 2 (CRITICAL): Fixed green/black flicker on Windows-first USB — encoder resize logic now requires 3 consecutive frames at the new size before re-initializing (hysteresis). Single-frame DXGI size changes (common during VDD startup/transitions) were triggering unnecessary encoder re-inits that reset android_ready, causing Android decoder reconfiguration and green/black frames. ✅
  - Bug 3 (MEDIUM): Improved Extended mode → Mirror debugging — added [MODE] logging throughout (sendModeSelection, DiscoveryClient.sendMode, TcpStreamReceiver). Added direct UDP fallback in sendModeSelection() for case where discoverClient is null (e.g., due to race with USB probe). Changed Log.d→Log.i in sendMode(). ✅
  - Bug 4 (MEDIUM): USB reconnect stays WiFi — Bug 1 fix (direct setMode without stopReceiver) also removes the 600ms delay for idle WiFi→USB switch, making reconnect faster and more reliable. Improved AdbUsbSetup log: "[USB Monitor] adb reverse re-run: SUCCESS/FAIL". ✅
- Phase 1 HELLO handshake regressions (2 critical bugs):
  - Bug A (CRITICAL): Fixed HELLO always carrying mode=Mirror — root cause: in TcpStreamReceiver.start() the !sessionStarted block reset pendingMode=null on every reconnect before the first successful write. When Windows' 5 s RCVTIMEO closed the socket after the user tapped the dialog (write not yet sent, so sessionStarted still false), the user's selection was wiped; modeSelected=true then blocked the dialog from re-showing; the wait-loop timed out → modeActual=null → HELLO not sent → WaitForMode defaulted to Mirror. Fix: removed pendingMode=null from the !sessionStarted block. pendingMode is null by default in a freshly constructed TcpStreamReceiver so new sessions remain clean. Changed file: TcpStreamReceiver.kt. ✅
  - Bug B (CRITICAL): Fixed codec-config resend loop breaking streaming — root cause: VideoDecoder.configure() called onConfigured?.invoke() even on duplicate SPS (dedup path). resend_thread sends codec_config every 2 s unconditionally; each duplicate triggered onCodecConfigured(), which for WiFi (after firstFrameReceived=true) called stopReceiver() — killing streaming 2 s after the first frame arrived; for USB it reset firstFrameReceived=false causing continuous spurious ACKs. Fix: removed onConfigured call from the dedup branch (silent return). Windows-restart detection still works because that produces a *different* SPS, bypassing dedup and reaching the full reconfigure + onConfigured path. Changed file: VideoDecoder.kt. ✅
- #19 third post-testing session (logcat-confirmed bugs):
  - Bug 1 (CRITICAL): Fixed Windows closing TCP connection every 3s — Android's usbPollRunnable calls tcpProbe() which creates a real TCP connection to port 7777. TcpVideoServer::AcceptLoop() was accepting probe connections, reading an empty mode line, then: (a) updating mode_value_ to 0 (Mirror), waking WaitForMode() with wrong mode; (b) calling reconnect_cb_() which reset android_ready=false; (c) setting client_sock_ to probe socket, closing the real streaming socket. Fixed in AcceptLoop(): if mode line is empty → log "[USB/video] empty mode line (TCP probe) — discarded" + closesocket + continue, WITHOUT touching client_sock_, mode_value_, or reconnect_cb_. Also added guard for unrecognised (non-POCKETDISPLAY_MODE) lines. ✅
  - Bug 2 (MEDIUM): Fixed Extended mode reverts to Mirror on reconnect — setMode(usb=true) now always resets modeSelected=false, modeDialogShowing=false, selectedMode="mirror" in the USB branch, even when stopReceiver() is not called (idle WiFi→USB switch). Previously, stale modeSelected=true from a prior WiFi session caused autoStartIfNeeded() to skip the mode dialog and start TcpStreamReceiver with the last selectedMode value (which could be "mirror"). ✅

## HELLO Handshake (Phase 1 — unified in-band mode selection)
Both USB and WiFi now use the same binary HELLO message to deliver mode.
Frame: [4-byte BE length = 11][type=4][version=1][mode 0/1][w uint32BE][h uint32BE]
- type 4 = kHello, version 1, mode 0=mirror / 1=extend
- w/h = Android screen dimensions
USB: TcpStreamReceiver sends HELLO as the first framed message on the streaming TCP socket.
WiFi: Android opens a short-lived TCP connection to Windows:7777, sends HELLO, closes.
  Windows runs a TcpVideoServer on :7777 in both USB and WiFi modes to accept HELLO.
Probe guard: connections that close without a valid HELLO are discarded silently.
Unknown HELLO version: log + default Mirror (graceful reject).
UDP port 7779 is now ANNOUNCEMENT-ONLY: POCKETDISPLAY_HOST + POCKETDISPLAY_CLIENT.
  POCKETDISPLAY_MODE packets are no longer sent or handled.

## Phase 2 — Session-based server (refactor/unified-connection)
Replaced the linear main.cpp streaming script with a persistent server.
- TcpVideoServer::SetHelloCallback() fires on the AcceptLoop thread for every valid HELLO.
  USB: hands off the accepted SOCKET to DirectSocketStreamer (caller owns it).
  WiFi: also hands off SOCKET to DirectSocketStreamer (Phase 3 change — TCP video for WiFi too).
- Session class owns ScreenCapture + encoder + TouchReceiver + stream/resend/cursor threads.
  Start() → initialises all; Stop() → signals running_=false, closes streamer socket (unblocks
  send()), joins all threads, releases capture.
- On new HELLO: old Session::Stop() called, new Session created.
- On disconnect: Session::StreamLoop detects SendFrame failure → running_=false;
  main loop detects !IsRunning() → Stop() + reset → waits for next HELLO.
- Discovery broadcaster runs continuously on a background thread; pauses while a
  Session is active (prevents spurious WiFi reconnects during USB session).
- WaitForMode() and one-shot RunDiscovery blocking calls removed from main().

## Phase 3 — Unified TCP transport (refactor/unified-connection)
All video and touch now flows over TCP for both USB and WiFi modes.
- Windows: TcpVideoServer hands off accepted SOCKET for WiFi too (not just USB).
  TouchReceiver is TCP-only (UdpLoop removed). UdpStreamer removed from build.
- Android: ConnectionManager replaces the volatile-flag + polling pattern in MainActivity.
  Manages USB/WiFi lifecycle, discovery, session start/stop, mode persistence.
  TcpStreamReceiver gains a `host` parameter (supports WiFi IP, not just 127.0.0.1).
  TouchSender is TCP-only (UDP socket and useTcp param removed).
  MainActivity is now UI-only — all connection logic delegated to ConnectionManager.

## ADB Multi-device Fix
- DetectUsbDevice() / GetUsbSerial() now skip entries whose serial contains ':'
  (wireless-adb format e.g. 192.168.1.5:5555).
- RunAdbUsbReverse() and ClearAdbReverse() pass -s <usb_serial> on every adb
  call, preventing "error: more than one device/emulator" when wireless adb is
  also active alongside a USB device.

## Connection Flow (USB — Phase 2)
1. Windows starts → DetectUsbDevice() → RunAdbUsbReverse(-s <serial>); StartUsbMonitorThread
2. TcpVideoServer always-on HELLO listener on :7777
3. Android connects → sends HELLO; AcceptLoop fires hello_cb_ (hands off SOCKET)
4. Session::Start() → ScreenCapture + encoder init; touch receiver on :7778 (TCP)
5. ResendLoop sends stream_info + codec_config every 2s
6. Android TouchSender connects → ACK received → android_ready=true → frames flow
7. On disconnect: StreamLoop fails → running_=false → main tears down session; loops back to 2

## Connection Flow (WiFi — Phase 3)
1. Windows starts → discovery broadcaster on UDP :7779 (continuous background thread)
2. TcpVideoServer always-on HELLO listener on :7777
3. Android receives POCKETDISPLAY_HOST → user taps mode dialog
4. Android opens short-lived TCP to :7777 → sends HELLO → Windows keeps socket open
5. AcceptLoop fires hello_cb_ (hands off SOCKET for both USB and WiFi)
6. Session::Start() → capture + encoder + DirectSocketStreamer (TCP); touch receiver on :7778 (TCP)
7. ACK received → android_ready=true → frames flow
8. On disconnect/silence: main detects !IsRunning() → Stop(); discovery resumes

## Important Rules
- Never use system() or _popen() for adb — causes cmd popup
- Use CreateProcess() with CREATE_NO_WINDOW for silent adb calls
- Extended mode uses the bundled VirtualDrivers Virtual Display Driver at windows/drivers/virtual-display; install is attempted only when extended mode is selected
- Always test: Windows-first, Android-first, AND reconnect scenarios
- Do not break existing working flows when fixing new issues
